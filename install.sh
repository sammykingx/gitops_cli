# Installation Script for gitops cli tool
#
# This script safely installs the application on the user terminal
# Also note that it asks for your github token during installation
# to enable the smooth running of the application when installed.
#
# Though the token can be skipped during installation (not advised)
# you can still save your token to $APP_PATH with name of file $APP_TOKEN
# The token is needed for authentication purpose by github.
